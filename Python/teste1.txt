The Ulianov Elliptic Cryptography (UEC) model represents a revolutionary shift in the field of digital security. Unlike traditional asymmetric algorithms such as RSA, which rely on integer factorization and are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, UEC employs high-precision real-number arithmetic, elliptical transformations, and entropy-based encoding to create an encryption system that cannot be analytically reversed. 
What makes UEC truly unique is its ability to perform encryption using private keys and defer access to data until a corresponding public key is revealed. This enables use cases like time-locked documents, posthumous will decryption, and controlled access to confidential files by trusted parties. The cryptographic strength of UEC is amplified by the use of Pi-based pseudo-random sequences and non-invertible mathematical structures that resist both brute force and algorithmic inference.
This file serves as a practical demonstration of the UEC encryption process. 
It has been encoded using the DIG3 format, encrypted with a real-number public key of 7000 digits, and embedded into a floating-point structure with holographic dispersion. The decryption process validates the integrity of the original data by verifying CRCs, data length, and header conformity, offering multi-layered protection far beyond traditional systems.
