üì∞ Brazilian Scientist Develops Unbreakable Cryptography Algorithm
Against Quantum Computers
###Innovation proposes a secure alternative to RSA and promises to safeguard digital privacy in the quantum computing era.

New York, 2025 ‚Äî In a global scenario of growing concern over digital security, a Brazilian scientist may have found the key to the future of cryptography.

Dr. Policarpo Yoshin Ulianov, an electrical engineer and PhD in Artificial Intelligence, has developed a new cryptographic algorithm called UEC ‚Äì Ulianov Elliptic Cryptography, which emerges as one of the first viable solutions to the threat quantum computers pose to digital privacy.

Currently, systems like RSA, widely used for HTTPS, encrypted emails, banking transactions, and cryptocurrencies, rely on the difficulty of factoring very large prime numbers. This method works like a digital safe with two locks: a public key (shared openly), used only to lock the safe, and a private key (kept secret), used to unlock it.

RSA uses two large prime numbers ‚Äî for instance, with 350 digits each ‚Äî to generate a 700-digit public key. While it‚Äôs easy to share this public key, factoring it to retrieve the original primes is computationally unfeasible. Even the world‚Äôs most powerful supercomputers would take billions of times the age of the universe to break a 2048-bit RSA key.

However, with the advent of quantum computers, this barrier may soon vanish. These machines process multiple possibilities simultaneously using qubits (quantum bits), making it possible to factor large integers in a very short time. With just 4,000 to 8,000 qubits, a quantum computer could break modern RSA encryption in seconds.

Dr. Ulianov warns:
‚ÄúChina already has quantum computers with around 100 qubits, and experts say a practical threshold for breaking RSA encryption may be reached within the next 5 to 6 years.‚Äù

"All current digital security ‚Äî from bank transfers to cryptocurrencies and online logins ‚Äî could be compromised overnight. It would be the end of privacy as we know it," Ulianov warns.

While most post-quantum algorithms still rely on integers, UEC is unique for using real numbers with extremely high precision ‚Äî ranging from 2,500 to 10,000 decimal places. Between two integers there are finitely many primes, but between two real numbers lie infinitely many values. Moreover, UEC is based on mathematical functions that are irreversible by definition, rendering them secure even against quantum decryption.

"Quantum computers can break multiplications, but they cannot solve functions that have no known inverse," Ulianov explains.

Inspired by ellipse geometry, Ulianov developed a new branch of mathematics called Ulianov Elliptic Trigonometry, which includes elliptical versions of sine and cosine functions. This enables the creation of encryption functions that are mathematically irreversible to anyone lacking the correct private keys.
The UEC source code is already available for free as open-source software:

Ulianov also proposes a global digital identity system, where unique IDs can be registered online for secure authentication, verified pseudonyms, and digital signatures. These IDs could later be linked to official documents (e.g., passport, CPF, academic diplomas) through local notary validation.
‚ÄúIf widely adopted, this technology could give every citizen a strong, decentralized digital identity ‚Äî independent of governments or corporations.‚Äù

According to ChatGPT-4, the UEC model is:
"Profoundly elegant, conceptually innovative, and potentially revolutionary for cryptography in the quantum era."

Ulianov concludes with an appeal:
‚ÄúThis may be the last window of time when ordinary people still have a real chance to protect their privacy. We must spread, test, and secure this technology before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

This Brazilian innovation is already drawing attention in international cryptography forums and may become a cornerstone for the future of global digital security, replacing the entire prime-number-based encryption system with real-number-based mathematics.

An interesting detail: the UEC model uses 7 keys (seven real numbers with 2,500 to 10,000 decimal digits): 3 public keys and 4 private keys. Ulianov explains:
‚ÄúThe UEC method naturally uses multiple keys, but its architecture ensures that private keys cannot be derived from public ones. Obtain a set of 4D key from a set of 3D key It's like trying to reconstruct a 3D object from a 2D shadow ‚Äî there are infinite possibilities, but only one correct match.  Not even a quantum computer can overcome that kind of mathematical barrier.‚Äù

Thus, UEC gives new meaning to the old expression:
‚ÄúA secret kept under seven keys.‚Äù
Now it‚Äôs more than a metaphor ‚Äî it's a mathematically inviolable vault.
